# Welcome to the Sentient Beings Open Source Community!

The goal of this community is to learn and grow together. I wanted to implement research papers and contribute to the field of Embodied AI, which is why I created this open-source organization. 

Currently, I'm working on the following projects—some are already completed, while others are still in progress:

## Key Projects You Can Contribute To:
- [**Project Alpha**](https://github.com/Sentient-Beings/RobotwithMemory): A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based solution for **autonomous robot navigation**, where robots remember and use information from past experiences to navigate based on user input.
- [**Project Beta**](https://github.com/Sentient-Beings/Language-to-Actions): Mapping **natural language commands** to **robotic actions**, enabling robots to understand the scene and perform actions using a **specially designed API** based on user instructions fully autonomously.
- [**Project Gamma**](https://github.com/Sentient-Beings/robot_learning.git): Text + Pixels to Actions—this project focuses on arm robots, particularly single-arm robots. Using a vision-language action model, we translate user commands into the robot's joint space. [Work in progress]

These projects are designed to be accessible, with clear documentation and beginner-friendly open issues. Please contribute, share your ideas and opinions, or suggest new projects!

## How to Get Started:
1. **Explore the repositories** and find a project that excites you 
2. Check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in each repository for guidelines on getting involved
3. **Start a new project!** You can create your own project under Sentient Beings. Open a discussion with your idea or directly contact me, and I'll help you get started.

## Stay Connected:
If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-ahmed-845a371b6/)

Can’t wait to see what we can build together!
