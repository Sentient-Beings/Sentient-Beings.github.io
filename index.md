# Welcome to the Sentient Beings Open Source Community!

We're on a mission to revolutionize robotics through excelling in embodied AI.

Open collaboration is really powerful and so we’re excited to invite developers, engineers, and AI enthusiasts to join us on this journey. Whether you’re new to robotics or an experienced developer, there’s a place for you in our community!

## Our Vision ? 
Empower robots with the capability to reason and semantically understand our world in better ways. 

## Key Projects You Can Contribute To:
- [**Project Alpha**](https://github.com/Sentient-Beings/RobotwithMemory): A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based solution for **autonomous robot navigation**, where robots remember and use information from past experiences.
- [**Project Beta**](https://github.com/Sentient-Beings/Language-to-Actions): Mapping **natural language commands** to **robotic actions**, enabling robots to understand and perform tasks based on verbal instructions fully autonomously. 

These projects are designed to be accessible, with clear documentation and open issues that are beginner-friendly. Your ideas and contributions are invaluable to us! We are continiously evolving and trying new and different things. Feel free to add more projects, this is just the beginning !

1. **Explore our repositories** and find a project that excites you.
2. Check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in each repository for guidelines on how to get involved.
